    <h3 class = "text">You are now about to take a calculus quiz, so here a few things before you start.</h3>
    <h3 class = "text">Each section will have 4 questions and will be based on each unit of the AP Calculus curriculum. This means you will answer 4 questions for Unit 1, 
    then 4 questions for Unit 2, etc. You are not allowed to use a calculator! Each sections was carefully made so you do not have to use one. They are completely able to be done by hand. 
    There will be a total of 32 questions. To pass, you will need at least 3 questions correct for each section. If you fail in any of the sections, you will have to restart from the very beginning. Good luck~</h3>
